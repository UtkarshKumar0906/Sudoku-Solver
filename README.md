# Sudoku-Solver

The solve method is a recursive function that explores different possibilities for each empty cell in the Sudoku board. The algorithm employs backtracking, which means it tries out different values for each cell and backtracks when it encounters an inconsistency. If a solution is found, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
